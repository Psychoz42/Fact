Commands:
0 (0) - exit programm
1 (1) - enter next script value into stack
2 (10) - print previous stack value
3 (11) - double previous stack value
4 (100) - sum two previous stack values
5 (101) - min two previous stack values
6 (110) - mult two previous stack values
7 (111) - div two previous stack values
8 (1000) - double previous stack value x times, x - previous script value
9 (1001) - copy curent stack into new memory stack with increasing index for every new mem stack
10 (1010) - add mem stack content with index of previous stack value into stack
11 (1011) - add last mem stack value with index of previous stack value into stack
12 (1100) - save curent stack in mem stack with index of previous stack value (clear mem stack)
13 (1101) - add curent stack to mem stack with index of previous stack value
14 (1110) - clear curent stack
15 (1111) - delete previous stack value
16 (10000) - delete x previous stack values, x - previous stack value
17 (10001) - enter previous stack value into stack as char in ASCII
18 (10010) - start new func writing, it stops at 19 command. New funcs have increasing index
19 (10011) - end func writing
20 (10100) - enter func commands in script, index of this func is previous stack value
21 (10101) - copy next script command into script x times, x - previous stack value
22 (10110) - print previous stack value without move to next line
23 (10111) - copy x-th stack value before x and enter it into stack, x - previous stack value
24 (11000) - swap two previous stack value
25 (11001) - delete x next script commands, x - previous stack value
26 (11010) - take 3 values from stack, previous is comparing type (0 - ==; 1 - !=; 2 - >; 3 - <; 4 - >=; 5 - <=), 2 more previously is comparing values (comparing in those order). If result is true will perform code until 27 command
27 (11011) - end of code section of last comparing command (and for else section too)
28 (11100) - else section for last comparing command
29 (11101) - double two previous stack values in those order
30 (11110) - copy 2nd previous stack value in mem stack with index of previous stack value
31 (11111) - delete last input value and put it into stack
